# DOMAIN DEPENDENCE OF NORM OF HARMONIC EXTENSION OPERATOR

We consider domain $\Omega$ with a part of the boundary $\Gamma$ where some 
boundary data is given. On $\partial\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ there is 0 
Dirichlet condition. Given the data $g\in H^{1/2}(\Gamma)$ we consider a 
map $E: H^{1/2}(\Gamma)\rightarrow H^1(\Omega)$ and the question of how $\lVert E \rVert$ 
depends on the geometry.

## How
The idea is that the norm is related to extremal eigenvalues of certain eigenvalue problems; 
in particular the Stekhlov problem and the problem of spectrum of Schur complement of the 
Babuska's mixed FEM for enforcing Dirichlet bcs by Lagrange multipliers.

## Roadmap 
- We established the relation between the eigenvalues of the two problems and thus can
  say something about trace inequality
- It is still not 100% clear how the above related to $E$
